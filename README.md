# Financial-Report-Generator
This python script is intended to automate the process of generating a Financial Report.
It integrates the precedent modules **"Balance Sheet Generator" and "Net Profits Calculator"** that calculate **the company's balance sheet (assets) and income statement (revenues, costs and net profits).**

The script uses **subprocess** to run each module independently, retrieve financial metrics, and compile results into a structured PDF report.
It is intended to be **scalable** and **expanded further** with additional components such as liabilities, cash flow statements or AI generated financial analysis.
